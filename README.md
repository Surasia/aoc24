# Advent Of Code 2024

This year, I'm doing AoC in Rust, as I believe I'm still not too familiar with its standard library.
Some restrictions:
- Not using ANY crates/libraries outside of libstd and libcore (+ regex because rust doesn't have it built-in)
- Commenting on any decisions I make while writing the code
- Only using standard library documentation, no stackoverflow etc.

Due to my timezone, I'm not able to participate in any leaderboard positions, and don't intend to anyway.
If you have any suggestions as to how I can improve any of my solutions (which I know, is probably quite a lot), please create a PR.
